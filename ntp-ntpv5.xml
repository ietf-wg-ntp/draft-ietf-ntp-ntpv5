    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol which enables computers to
        synchronize their clocks over network. Time is distributed from primary
        time servers to clients, which can be servers for other clients, and so
        on. Clients can use multiple servers simultaneously.</t>

      <t>NTPv5 is similar to <xref target="RFC5905">NTPv4</xref>. The main
        differences are:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>The protocol specification (this document) describes only the
            on-wire protocol. Filtering of measurements, security mechanisms,
            source selection, clock control, and other algorithms, are out of
            scope.</t>

          <t>For security reasons, NTPv5 drops support for the symmetric
            active, symmetric passive, broadcast, control, and private modes.
            The symmetric and broadcast modes are vulnerable to replay attacks.
            The control and private modes can be exploited for
            denial-of-service traffic amplification attacks. Only the client
            and server modes remain in NTPv5.</t>

            <t>Timestamps are clearly separated from values used as cookies.</t>
	    <!--UW: In general it would be advisable to define phrases before
		using them; "cookies", "MAC field" and "timescales" for
		example. -->

          <t>NTPv5 messages can be extended only with extension fields. The MAC
            field is wrapped in an extension field.</t>

          <t>Extension fields can be of any length, even indivisible by 4, but are
            padded to a multiple of 4 octets. Extension fields specified for
            NTPv4 are compatible with NTPv5.</t>

          <t>NTPv5 adds support for other timescales than UTC.</t>

          <t>The NTP era number is exchanged in the protocol, which extends the
            unambiguous interval of the client from 136 years to about 35000
            years.</t>

          <t>NTPv5 adds a new measurement mode to provide clients with more
          accurate transmit timestamps.</t>
	  <!--UW: Should that "new measurement mode" have a name? -->

          <t>NTPv5 works with sets of reference IDs to prevent synchronization
          loops over multiple hosts.</t>
	  <!--UW: Should "sets of reference IDs" be defined, specifically
	      "reference ID"? -->

          <t>Resolution of the root delay and root dispersion fields is
          improved.</t>
	  <!--UW: Should the improvement be explained? What is it
	      specifically? -->

          <t>Clients don't leak information about their clock (e.g.
            timestamps).</t>
        </list>
      </t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

          capitals, as shown here.</t>

    <section title="Basic Concepts">
      <t>The distance to the reference time sources in the hierarchy of servers
        is called stratum. Primary time servers, which are synchronized to the
        reference clocks, are stratum 1, their clients are stratum 2, and so
        on.</t>

      <t>Root delay measures the total delay on the path to the reference time
        source used by the primary time server. Each client on the path adds to
        the root delay the NTP delay measured to the server it considers best
        for synchronization. The delay includes network delays and any delays
        between timestamping of NTP messages and their actual reception and
        transmission. Half of the root delay estimates the maximum error of the
        clock due to asymmetries in the delay.</t>

      <t>Root dispersion estimates the maximum error of the clock due to the
        instability of the clocks on the path and instability of NTP
        measurements. Each server on the path adds its own dispersion to the
        root dispersion. Different clock models can be used. In a simple model,
        the clock can have a constant dispersion rate, e.g. 15 ppm as used in
        NTPv4.</t>

      <t>The sum of the root dispersion and half of the root delay is called
        root distance. It is the estimated maximum error of the clock, taking
        into account asymmetry in delay and stability of clocks and
        measurements.</t>

      <t>Servers have randomly generated reference IDs to prevent
        synchronization loops.</t>

    <section title="Data Types">
      <!--UW: In general I'd define any data type that occurs in a packet here
      -->
      <t>NTPv5 uses few different data types. They are all in the network
        order. Beside signed and unsigned integers, it has also the following
        fixed-point types:

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="time16"><vspace/>
            A 16-bit signed fixed-point type containing values in seconds. It has 1
            sign bit (i.e. it is just the sign) and 15 bits describing the fractional
            part. The minimum value is the fraction -32767/32768 (almost -1
            second), the maximum value is 32767/32768 (almost 1 second), and
            the resolution is about 30 microseconds. The type has a special
            value of 0x8000 ("-0"), which indicates an unknown value.</t>

          <t hangText="time32"><vspace/>
            A 32-bit unsigned fixed-point type containing values in seconds. It has 4
            bits describing the unsigned integral part and 28 bits describing
	    the fractional part. The maximum value is
            16 seconds and the resolution is about 3.7 nanoseconds. Note that
            this is different from the 32-bit time format in NTPv4.</t>

          <t hangText="timestamp64"><vspace/>
            A 64-bit unsigned fixed-point type containing a timestamp
	    describes in seconds. It has 32 signed
            integer bits and 32 fractional bits. It spans an interval of about
            136 years and has a resolution of about 0.23 nanoseconds. It can be
            used in different timescales. In the UTC timescale it is the number
            of SI seconds since 1 Jan 1972 plus 2272060800, excluding leap
	    <!--UW: Explain the magic number! -->
            seconds. Timestamps in the TAI timescale are the same except they
            include leap seconds and extra 10 seconds for the original
            difference between TAI and UTC in 1972, when leap seconds were
            introduced. One interval covered by the type is called an NTP era.
            The era starting at the epoch is era number 0, the following era is
            number 1, and so on.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <!--UW: I would add more types like s_log8 (signed number expressed as a
          power of two using 8 bits, maybe including an undefined value),
          u_log8 (unsigned number expressed as a power of two using 8 bits,
          s_i16 (signed interger using 16 bits) -->
      <t>Some fields use a logarithmic scale, where an 8-bit signed integer
        represents the rounded log2 value of seconds. For example, a log2 value
        of 4 is 2^4 (2 to the power of 4, 16) seconds, or a log2 value of -2
	is 2^-2 (0.25 seconds).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Message Format">
      <t>NTPv5 servers and clients exchange messages as UDP datagrams. Clients
        send requests to servers and servers send them back responses. The
        format of the UDP payload is shown in Figure <xref format="counter"
          target="message-format"/>.</t>

      <figure align="center" anchor="message-format"
              title="Format of NTPv5 messages">
	<!--UW: I'd assign a short label for the fields with a long name, used
	     to reference them uniquely in the main text (like "CC" for
	     "Client Cookie") -->

      <t>Each NTPv5 message has a header containing the following fields:

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Leap indicator (LI)"><vspace/>
            A 2-bit field which can have the following values: 0 (normal), 1
            (leap second inserted at the end of the month), 2 (leap second
            deleted at the end of the month), 3 (not synchronized). The values
            1 and 2 are set at most 14 days in advance before the leap second.
            In requests it is always 0.</t>

          <t hangText="Version Number (VN)"><vspace/>
            A 3-bit field containing the value 5.</t>

          <t hangText="Mode"><vspace/>
            A 3-bit field containing the value 3 (request) or 4 (response).</t>

          <t hangText="Scale"><vspace/>
            A 4-bit identifier of the timescale. In requests it is the
            requested timescale. In responses it is the timescale of the
            receive and transmit timestamps. Defined values are:

            <list style="hanging">

            </list>
          </t>

          <t hangText="Stratum"><vspace/>
            A 4-bit field containing the stratum of the server. Primary time
            servers have a stratum of 1, their clients have a stratum of 2, and
            so on. The value of 0 indicates an unknown or infinite stratum. In
            requests it is always 0.</t>

            <t hangText="Poll"><vspace/>
	    <!--UW: This could be the s_log8 data type, no need to explain it
	        again, just saying it specifies the polling interval in
	        seconds. -->
            An 8-bit signed integer containing the polling interval as a
            rounded log2 value in seconds. In requests it is the current
            polling interval. In responses it is the minimum allowed polling
            interval.</t>

            included in the message as a rounded log2 value in seconds. In
            requests, which don't contain any timestamps, it is always 0.</t>

          <t hangText="Flags"><vspace/>
            An 8-bit integer that can contain the following flags:

            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="0x1: Unknown leap"><vspace/>
                In requests it is 0. In responses a value of 1 indicates the

                about leap seconds and the client should interpret the Leap
                Indicator as having only two possible values: synchronized (0)
                and not synchronized (3).</t>
              <t hangText="0x2: Interleaved mode"><vspace/>
                In requests a value of 1 is a request for a response in the
                interleaved mode. In responses a value of 1 indicates the
                response is in the interleaved mode.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t hangText="Era"><vspace/>

            <t hangText="Timescale Offset"><vspace/>
	    <!--UW: This could be the s_i16 type -->
            A 16-bit value specific to the selected timescale, which is

      <t>Each extension field has a header which contains a 16-bit type and
        16-bit length. The length is in octets and it includes the header. The
        minimum length is 4, i.e. an extension field does not have to contain
        any data. If the length is not divisible by 4, the extension field is
        padded with zeroes to the smallest multiple of 4 octets.</t>

      <t>If a request contains an extension field, the server MUST include this
        extension field in the response unless the specification of the
        extension field states otherwise, or the server does not support the
        extension field. A client can interpret the absence of an expected
        extension field in a response as an indication that the server does not
        support the extension field.</t>

      <t>Extension fields specified for NTPv4 can be included in NTPv5 messages
        as specified for NTPv4.</t>

	<t>The rest of this section describes new extension fields specified for
	<!--UW: "new" is bad here; I'd leave it out as the rest of the draft

        NTPv5. Clients are not required to use or support any of these
        extension fields, but servers are required to support some extension

        <t>This field is used by servers to pad the response to the same length

          specifically allowed to be placed after a MAC or another
          authenticator field.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reference IDs Request and Response Extension Fields">
        <t>Each NTPv5 server has a randomly generated 120-bit reference
	ID. The
	<!--UW: At this point tha "magic" value 120 should be explained; why
	    120? -->
          extension fields described in this section are used to exchange sets
          of reference IDs in order to detect synchronization loops, i.e. when
          a client is synchronizing (directly or indirectly) to one of its own
          clients.</t>

        <t>As each client can be synchronized to an unlimited number of
          servers (and there can be up to 15 strata of servers), the reference
          IDs are exchanged as a Bloom filter instead of a list to limit the
	  <!--UW: Add a reference for "Bloom Filter" -->
          amount of data that needs to be exchanged.</t>

        <t>The Bloom filter is an array of 4096 bits. When empty, all bits are
          zero. To add a reference ID to the filter, the 120-bit value of the
          reference ID is split into 10 12-bit values and the bits of the array
          at the 10 positions given by the 12-bit values are set to one.</t>

        <t>A server maintains a copy of the filter for each server it is using
          as an NTP client. The filter provided by the server to clients is the
          union of the filters (using the bitwise OR operation) of the server's
          sources selected for synchronization and the server's own reference
        ID.</t>
	<!--UW: The above sounds quite abstract; maybe give a an example
	    (appendix?) -->

        <t>If the server uses a previous version of NTP for some of its
          sources, the reference IDs added to the filter are generated from
          their IP addresses as the first 120 bits of the
          <xref target="RFC1321">MD5</xref> sum of the address.</t>

        <t>A client checking whether the server's set of reference IDs contains
          the client's own reference ID checks whether the bits at the 10
          positions corresponding to the 12-bit values from the reference ID
          are all set to one.</t>

          <t>When a client which serves time to other clients detects a
	  <!--UW: Isn't "a client which serves time to other clients" "the
	      server part of a client"? -->

          synchronization loop with one of its servers, it SHOULD stop using
	  <!--UW: Formally define "synchronization loop"! -->
          the <!--UW: particular -->server for synchronization. When the client's reference ID is
          no longer detected in the server's filter, it SHOULD wait for a
          random number of polling intervals (e.g. between 0 and 4) before
          selecting the server again. The random delay helps with stabilization
          of the selection in longer loops.</t>

        <t>False positives are possible. The probability of a collision grows
          with the number of reference IDs in the filter. With 26 reference IDs
          it is about 1e-12.<!-- please explain giving a formula! --> With 118 IDs it is about 1e-6. The client MAY avoid
          selecting a server which has too many bits set in the filter (e.g.
          more than half) to reduce the probability of the collision for its
          own clients. A client which detected a synchronization loop MAY
          change its own reference ID to limit the duration of the potential
          collision.</t><!--UW: Please explain the last sentence! -->

        <t>The filter can be exchanged as a single 512-octet array, or it can
          be exchanged in smaller chunks over multiple NTP messages, making
          them shorter, but delaying the detection of the synchronization
          loop.</t>

        <t>The request extension field specifies the offset of the requested
          chunk in the filter as a number of octets. The requested length of
          the chunk is given by the length of the extension field. The response
          extension field MUST have the same length as the request extension
          field. If the request contains an invalid offset, the extension field
          MUST be ignored.</t>

        <t>The client SHOULD use requests of a constant length for the
          association to avoid adding a variation to the measured NTP
          delay.</t>

      <section title="Correction Extension Field">

        <t>Processing and queueing delays in network switches and routers may
          be a significant source of jitter and asymmetry in network delay,
          which has a negative impact on accuracy and stability of clocks
          synchronized by NTP. A solution to this problem is defined in the
          <xref target="IEEE1588">Precision Time Protocol (PTP)</xref>, which
          is a different protocol for synchronization of clocks in networks. In
          PTP a special type of switch or router, called a Transparent Clock
          (TC), updates a correction field in PTP messages to account for the
          time messages spend in the TC. This is accomplished by timestamping
          the message at the ingress and egress ports, taking the difference to
          determine time in the TC and adding this to the Delay Correction.
          Clients can account for the accumulated Delay Correction to determine
          a more accurate clock offset.</t>

        <t>The NTPv5 Delay Correction has the same format as the PTP
          correctionField to make it easier for manufacturers of switches and
          routers to implement NTP corrections. The format of the Correction

          as it is consistent for all forwarded packets of the same length. If
          the transmission speed or length of the packet is different, the
          beginning and end of the interval SHOULD correspond to the end of the

      <section title="Monotonic Timestamp Extension Field">

        <t>When a clock is synchronized to a time source, there is a compromise
          between time (phase) accuracy and frequency accuracy, because the
          frequency of the clock has to be adjusted to correct time errors that
          accumulate due to the frequency error (e.g. caused by changes in the
          temperature of the crystal). Faster corrections of time can minimize
          the time error, but increase the frequency error, which transfers to
          clients using that clock as a time source and increases their
          frequency and time errors. This issue can be avoided by transferring
          time and frequency separately using different clocks.</t>

        <t>The Monotonic Timestamp Extension Field contains an extra receive
          timestamp with a 32-bit epoch identifier captured by a clock which
          does not have corrected phase and can better transfer frequency than
          the clock which captures the receive and transmit timestamps in the
          header. The extension field has a constant length of 16 octets. In
          requests, the counter and timestamp are always 0.</t>

        <t>The epoch identifier <!--UW: It's "epoch ID" elsewhere; be consistent! -->is a random number which is changed when
          frequency transfer needs to be restarted, e.g. due to a step of the
          clock.</t>

      <!--UW: Shouldn't you give at least a sketch of the NTP algorithms here?
      -->
      <t>An NTPv5 client needs four timestamps to measure the offset and delay
        of its clock relative to the server's clock:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>T1 - client's transmit timestamp of a request</t>
          <t>T2 - server's receive timestamp of the request</t>
          <t>T3 - server's transmit timestamp of a response</t>
          <t>T4 - client's receive timestamp of the response</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The offset, delay and dispersion are calculated as:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>offset = ((T2 + T3) - (T4 + T1) + (Cd - Co)) / 2</t>
	  <!--UW: The use of the "Cd" and "Co" labels is inconsistent; see
	      what I write earlier on use of field names and labels -->
          <t>delay = |(T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2) - (Cd + Co)|</t>
          <t>dispersion = |T4 - T1| * DR</t>
        </list>

        where<!-- Shouldn't these definitions be given before the formulas? -->

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>T1, T2, T3, T4 are the receive and transmit timestamps of a
            request and response</t>
          <t>Co is the Origin Correction from the Correction Extension Field if
            present in the response and has acceptable values, zero otherwise</t>
          <t>Cd is the Delay Correction from the Correction Extension Field if
            present in the response and has acceptable values, zero otherwise</t>

	    <!--UW: Pleae define "client's dispersion rate"! -->
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The client can make measurements in the basic mode, or interleaved
        mode if supported on the server. In the basic mode, the transmit
        timestamp in the server response corresponds to the message which
        contains the timestamp itself. In the interleaved mode it corresponds
        to a previous response identified by the server cookie. The
        interleaved mode enables the server to provide the client with a more
        accurate transmit timestamp which is available only after the
      response was formed or sent.</t>
      <!--UW: Explain interleave mode in greater detail; leaving out the
	  algorithms and just claiming the "correct" values should be in the

      <t>For NTPv4, the interleaved mode is described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ntp-interleaved-modes">NTP Interleaved Modes</xref>.
        The difference between the NTPv5 and NTPv4 interleaved modes is that in
        NTPv5 it is enabled with a flag and the previous transmit timestamp on
        the server is identified by the server cookie instead of the receive
        timestamp.</t>

      <t>An example of an NTPv5 exchange using the interleaved mode is shown in
        Figure <xref format="counter" target="interleaved-exchange"></xref>.
        The messages in the basic and interleaved mode are indicated with B and
        I respectively. The timestamps t3' and t11' correspond to the same
        transmissions as t3 and t11, but they may be less accurate. The first
	<!--UW: It's not obvious what the reason for t3' and T11' is -->
        exchange is in the basic mode followed by a second exchange in the
        interleaved mode. For the third exchange, the client request is in the
        interleaved mode, but the server response is in the basic mode, because
        the server no longer had the timestamp t7 (e.g. it was dropped to save
        timestamps for other clients using the interleaved mode).</t>

    <section title="Client Operation">
      <t>An NTPv5 client can use one or multiple servers. It has a separate
        association with each server. It makes periodic measurements of its
        offset and delay to the server. It can filter the measurements and
        compare measurements from different servers to select and combine the
        best servers for synchronization. It can adjust its clock in order to
        minimize its offset and keep the clock synchronized. These algorithms
        are not specified in this document.</t>

      <t>The polling interval can be adjusted for the network conditions and
        stability of the clock. When polling a public server on Internet, the
        client SHOULD use at least a polling interval of 64 seconds, increasing
      up to at least 1024 seconds.</t>
      <!--UW: Why exactly those numbers; explain! -->

      <t>Each successful measurement provides the client with an offset, delay
        and dispersion. When combined with the server's root delay and
        dispersion, it gives the client an estimate of the maximum error.</t>

      <t>On each poll, the client:

                    seconds.</t>
                  <t hangText="Interleaved mode"> is set if the interleaved
                    mode is implemented, was requested, and a response in the interleaved mode
                    is possible (i.e. a transmit timestamp is associated with
                    the server cookie).</t>

              </t>

              <t>Era is set to the NTP era of the receive timestamp if it was valid.</t>

              <t>Timescale Offset is set to the timescale-specific offset, or
                0x8000 if unknown.</t>

              <t>Server Cookie is set when the interleaved
                mode is requested and it is supported by the server, even if
                the response cannot be in the requested mode due to the request
                having an unknown or zero server cookie. The cookie
                identifies a more accurate transmit timestamp of the response,
                which can be retrieved by the client later with another
              request. The cookie generation is implementation-specific.</t>
	      <!--UW: I'd expect "random" or "NONCE", but is this for

                request.</t>

              <t>Receive Timestamp is set to the server's receive timestamp of
                the request.</t>

              <t>Transmit Timestamp is set to a value which depends on the
                measurement mode. In the basic mode it is the server's current
                time when the message if formed. In the interleaved mode it is
                the transmit timestamp of the previous response identified by
                the server cookie in the request, captured at some point after
                the message was formed.</t>

          <t>Adds the Padding Extension field if necessary to make the length

          <t>Drops the response if it is longer than the request to prevent
            traffic amplification.</t>

          <t>Sends the response.</t>

    <section title="Network Time Security with NTPv5">
      <t>The <xref target="RFC8915">Network Time Security</xref> mechanism uses
        the NTS-KE protocol to establish keys and negotiate the next protocol.
        NTPv5 is added as a new protocol to the Network Time Security Next
        Protocols Registry, which can be negotiated by NTPv5 clients and
        servers supporting NTS.</t>

      <t>No new NTS-KE records are specified for NTPv5. The records that were
        specified for NTPv4 (i.e. NTPv4 New Cookie, NTPv4 Server Negotiation,
        and NTPv4 Port Negotiation) are reused for NTPv5.</t>

      <t>The NTS extension fields specified for NTPv4 are compatible with
        NTPv5. No new extension fields are specified.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="NTPv5 Negotiation in NTPv4">
      <t>NTPv5 messages are not compatible with NTPv4, even if they do not
        contain any extension fields. Some widely used NTPv4 implementations are
        known to ignore the version and interpret all requests as NTPv4. Their
        responses to NTPv5 requests have a zero client cookie, which means they
        fail the client's validation and are ignored.</t>

      <t>The implementations are also known to not respond to requests
        with an unknown extension field, which prevents an NTPv4 extension
        field to be specified for NTPv5 negotiation. Instead, the reference
        timestamp field in the NTPv4 header is reused for this purpose.</t>

      <t>An NTP server which supports both NTPv4 and NTPv5 SHOULD check the
        reference timestamp in all NTPv4 client requests. If the reference
        timestamp contains the value 0x4E5450354E545035 ("NTP5NTP5" in ASCII),
        it SHOULD respond with the same reference timestamp to indicate
        it supports NTPv5.</t>

      <t>An NTP client which supports both NTPv4 and NTPv5, does not use NTS,
        and is not configured to use a particular NTP version, SHOULD start
        with NTPv4 and set the reference timestamp to 0x4e5450354e545035. If
        the server responds with the same reference timestamp, the client
        SHOULD switch to NTPv5. If no valid response is received for a number
        of requests (e.g. 8), the client SHOULD switch back to NTPv4.</t>
